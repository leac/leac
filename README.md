### A web programmer from Israel.

I work on both server-side and client-side. Mainly Wordpress, some Moodle. Started my web career with ASP.NET and now also write in PHP.

I have a blog in Hebrew in which I write about interesting posts and articles I've read regarding web development, and about interesting projects I've taken part in.
